To do:
Test this. If successful, push it.
Test with case1
Test with case1 continue
Test with case2
Test with case2 continue
Test with case3
Test with case3 continue

Make sure fitnessTemp are deleted between runs so that the sim doesn't 
get hung up.

gens = 100




We have said that now, each time we run evolveSwarms.py, our first swarm starts on the "currentBotNum" for the botNumber
